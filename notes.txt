API notes     

heroku doesnt need node_modules or .env files so you can put them in .gitignore

There are 2 git repositories we need to worry about, one that is in github and the other is in heroku.
After getting the most recent code from github, you can push into heroku

Mongodb .updateOne, .updateMany functions do not go through schema verification, so do not use unless absolutely necessary
Check to see if function does validation, like the .findOne... functions

__v in collection is the "version key". It describes the number of internal revision done on the document/instance.
